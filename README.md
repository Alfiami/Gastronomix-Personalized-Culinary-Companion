# GASTRONOMIX : Personalize Culinary Companion 

This project aims to tackle the common issue of unhealthy eating habits among college students. Our goal is to help students make better food choices by offering personalized food recommendations that consider their budget, nutritional preferences, and individual characteristics. We want to encourage healthier eating habits, reduce reliance on quick but unhealthy foods, and assist students in managing their finances when it comes to daily food expenses. Moreover, our aim is to support students in maintaining a balanced diet to prevent health issues like gastrointestinal diseases.

While there are other apps that offer food recommendations, Gastronomix stands out for its unique blend of features. Unlike similar apps, Gastronomix not only considers budget constraints and tracks calorie intake but also customizes recommendations based on each user's specific preferences. This means that the app provides tailored suggestions that cater to the individual needs of users.

Our project isn't just about suggesting what to eat; it's about helping students make informed choices that align with their personal preferences, health goals, and financial constraints. By combining these elements, Gastronomix aims to empower students to make healthier and more budget-conscious food choices, ultimately promoting a balanced and sustainable lifestyle.
