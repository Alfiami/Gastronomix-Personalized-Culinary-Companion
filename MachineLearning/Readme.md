## MACHINE LEARNING

The incorporation of machine learning within this project has been instrumental in facilitating a multi-faceted approach, commencing with the meticulous curation of food datasets encompassing vital variables such as food type, nutritional profiles, and pricing parameters. Subsequently, our efforts focused on data preprocessing, a critical phase involving the meticulous eradication of missing values, elimination of duplicate entries, and identification and rectification of anomalies within our dataset. 

An additional layer of refinement was introduced through the strategic utilization of the regex module to filter the dataset based on specific food allergies of the user, thereby ensuring the exclusion of consumables incompatible with the user's dietary restrictions. Employing the K-Means clustering technique, we undertook a comprehensive categorization endeavor, partitioning the dataset into 7 distinct clusters aligned with the envisioned food categories tailored for user accessibility and comprehensibility. 

A pivotal stride in this trajectory entailed the development of a sophisticated algorithm designed explicitly to furnish personalized food recommendations. This algorithm operates on a foundation of user-provided input data, allowing the machine to discern and subsequently propose consumables deemed suitable based on a nuanced understanding of the user's preferences. Notably, our model adeptly navigates considerations such as caloric content and budgetary constraints, ensuring that recommended food items align harmoniously with the user's preferences and dietary requisites. 

Conclusively, our model has demonstrated efficacy in proffering refined and personalized food recommendations, effectively amalgamating user preferences with pertinent nutritional and budgetary parameters. This amalgamation underscores the invaluable role of machine learning in augmenting user experience and facilitating informed, tailored dietary choices.
